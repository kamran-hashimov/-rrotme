# rrootme

This python program solve the room that called "rrotme" which is on the tryhackme.com.
Just start the program.
It might be take a few minutes to finish.
It works on Kali Linux. To be honest I didn't try it on Windows :)
All 3 files must be same directory.
If the program doesn't work properly then you should take a look codes. Because I built it based on my own computer. So there can be some differences. At least you should check the username of your OS.
You should have a account on the tryhackme.com so you can log in and you can get ip of the target machine.
You have to connect to the openvpn after that you can use the program to get flags. The program will create some files on the desktop. And one of them will be flags.txt. After finish the program you will be able to see all flags in the file.
