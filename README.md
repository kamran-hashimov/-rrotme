# rrootme

This python program solve the room that called "rrotme" which is on the tryhackme.com 
Just start the program
It might be take a few minutes to finish.
It works on Kali Linux. To be honest I didn't try it on Windows :)
All 3 files must be same directory.
If the program doesn't work properly then you should take a look codes. Because I built it based on my own computer. So there can be some differences. At least you should check the username of your OS.
You should have a account on the tryhackme.com so you can log in and you can get ip of the target machine.
